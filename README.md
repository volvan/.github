# Völva: The Scanner

Völva source code is available under the organisation (https://github.com/volvan), and allows other researchers to replicate, contribute or adapt the scanner for different contexts, including education, monitoring, and digital risk awareness.

## Hierarcy 

In this organisation, there are a few repositories, such as: 
- /scanner (this is the scanner source code it self)
- /website (the source code behind the public website) 

## About 

Völva introduces a distributed network scanning system with security, scalability, eﬀiciency, and reliability underpinning the design. 
It includes discovering live hosts, conducting horizontal port scans and providing insights with the [website](https://volva.frostbyte.is). 
Völva includes a report generator where scan results are summarised. 
Beyond its technical objectives, it aims to raise public awareness of cybersecurity threats and to enhance proactive national defence strategies. 
In the near future, this scanner could serve as a platform for further research into network reconnaissance, attack surface mapping, as well as provide practical experience for cybersecurity students and professionals. 
It’s designed to scan Large-Scale networks and could be applied in other nations.

It is released as source-available software. Funded through the European Union’s Defend Iceland grant.

## Release 

Releasing Völva as source-available increases transparency and invites collaboration.
While the code can be viewed and studied, certain restrictions apply to how it may be used, modified, or shared.
